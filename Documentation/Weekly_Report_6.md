# Week 6

## Areas of Focus

This week I focused on the following:
* Performance testing
* Small tweaks in the code and in the Javadoc in the interest of code legibility and maintainability.

### The Two Heuristics

I implemented a Manhattan heuristic for the search and created methods for testing and comparing the performance of each heuristic. I then simplified the sorting procedure for improved code legibility.

The Euclidian heuristic performs better on all boards, but the Manhattan heuristic is not untenable either. The Testing Document contains a summary of the results.

## Next Steps

As far as algorithms and data structures are concerned, the project is nearly finished. I will probably tweak the GUI a little and then focus on the rest of the required documentation (Usage and Testing).

## Time Spent on the Project This Week

Approximately 14 hours.
