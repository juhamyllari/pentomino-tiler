# Areas of Focus

This week I focused on two aspects of the project:
* Setting up a Java project.
* Implementing a rudimentary search algorithm to validate my approach.

## Setting up the Project
I created a maven / JavaFX project in Netbeans and a Github repository to house it. I also attended the opening session of the course.

## Implementing a crude version of the algorithm
As a proof of concept, I created a rudimentary (and very inefficient) search algorithm to find all solutions to the 6x10 board in Python. The algorithm terminated in 10 minutes or so and gave the correct number of solutions.

# Next Steps
Next I intend to create the 12 pentomino pieces in their 63 orientations. Then I will implement a simple version of the search algorithm.

# Questions and Difficulties
Nothing in particular at this point.

# Time Spent on the Project This Week
Approximately 10 hours.
