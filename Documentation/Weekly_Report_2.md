# Week 2
## Areas of Focus

This week my main areas of focus were:
* Creating methods for manipulating pentomino pieces.
* Documenting methods and classes and writing unit tests.

## Next Steps

I now have the necessary tools to create the 12 pentomino pieces (in all their orientations) from 12 strings. After creating the pieces I intend to move on to implementing a simple version of the search algorithm.

As it is convenient to keep pentominoes in ArrayLists, I will add ArrayList to the list of data structures to implement.

## Things I Learned or Thought about This Week

Writing lots of "small" methods leads to writing metric tons of Javadoc and unit tests. Avoiding unnecessary Javadoc may be another good reason to keep methods private whenever possible! As for unit testing, while writing tests for every tiny constituent part of some functionality is somewhat laborious, it may still be a better idea than not doing so.

## Questions and Difficulties

Are Java 8 streams, lambdas, the map function etc. allowed in the final version of the project as long as they are not used to "sneak in" data structures or algorithms that would otherwise have to be implemented?

## Time Spent on the Project This Week

Approximately 14 hours.
