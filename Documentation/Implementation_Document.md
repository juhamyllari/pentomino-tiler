# Implementation Document

## General Application Structure

The user interacts with a simple JavaFX GUI. The workflow is described in the [Usage Document](Usage.md).

### Setting Up the Search

The parameters of a search problem are contained in a Search object. The search object has methods for running the search and retrieving the results. The Search constructor takes as its sole parameter a Board object which represents the pentomino board to be tiled.

Pentomino pieces are represented by Piece objects, which in turn contain 5 Block objects, each representing one square of the piece. The Board class has a method for placing a Piece into a position (row, column) on the board.

### Running the Search

Pentomino Tiler finds all unique solutions to the tiling problem through an exhaustive recursive search. Each iteration takes as its argument a board and finds the first empty square of that board. It then fits each unused piece in all of its orientations into that square. If the placement is legal, the search method calls itself on the resulting board. The recursion bottoms out in the following cases:
* all pieces are used up, meaning that a solution has been found
* none of the remaining pieces can be placed into the first empty square.

#### Pruning Searches Leading to Duplicate Solutions

If tiling B can be derived from tiling A by rotation or mirroring, A and B are not considered unique solutions to the tiling problem. Pentomino Tiler therefore prunes all search branches where the (partially filled) board is a rotated and/or mirrored version of a board that has already been found by the search.

#### Preplacement of the X

Of the 12 pentomino pieces, the "X" piece (shaped like '+') has only one orientation; it is symmetrical with respect to rotation and mirroring. The tiling problem can therefore be significantly constrained by placing the X in each of its legal positions and running the search separately on each placement. Pentomino Tiler automatically does this, placing the X into each legal position in the quadrant closest to the origin of the board (or next to said quadrant, if the number of rows or columns is odd).

#### Euclidean Heuristic

It was stated above that each step of the recursive search attempts to fill the first empty square of the (possibly partially filled) board. However, we did not specify what "first" means in this context. Pentomino Tiler numbers the squares of the board according to their Euclidean distance from the origin. The board is therefore filled starting from the origin and proceeding away from it.

## Time and Space Complexity

The search is exponential (i.e. 2^poly(n), n signifying the number of pentomino pieces) in both time and space complexity. In Pentomino Tiler n is always 12, but conceptually we can of course consider larger values of n as well. (We still take the number of unique pieces to be 12 but allow for larger boards with a correspondingly larger budget of pieces.) A simple analysis of the computational complexity would then be as follows:

The search algorithm has a recursive depth of (roughly) n, as each call that is not a leaf of the recursion tree adds exactly one piece to the board. The branching factor is determined by the number of legal placements one call can make. This is bounded from above by a constant:
```
(number of unique pentomino pieces) * (maximum unique orientations a piece can have) * (blocks in a piece)
= 12 * 8 * 5
= 480.
```
The number of calls is therefore O(2^n). Each call has time complexity O(n), as determining the nearest empty square takes linear time.

## Limitations

It was stated in the [Requirements Document](Requirements_Document.md) that the user is allowed to choose from 2â€“3 search predefined search heuristics. Two heuristics (based on the Euclidean and Manhattan distances from the origin) were indeed implemented, but allowing the choice turned out to be a bad idea. The search process itself is not visualized in any way, meaning that the user would only see the discovered solutions rack up comparatively quickly (using the Euclidean heuristic) or comparatively slowly (using the Manhattan heuristic). The choice was therefore disallowed, and searches in the GUI always use the Euclidean heuristic.
